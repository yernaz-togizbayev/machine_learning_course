# 📊 Foundations of Data Analysis

This repository contains all assignments and project work completed for the **Foundations of Data Analysis (FDA)** course. The focus of this course was on applying Python to real-world data problems using both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques. Each assignment built progressively on theoretical and practical data science skills.
